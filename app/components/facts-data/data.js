    description: "I embarked on this dangerous journey of becoming a developer to seek for answers.. This quest was about finding, what else can I become exceptionally good at besides video games.

    description: "So I left my home.. Alright, I didn't, but starting something so foreign and new to me - really felt like a big step outside of comfort zone. But there is one trait that I really like about myself - I always finish what I have started. My competitive spirit and unmatched work ethic were my trustworthy sidekicks for entirety of this journey. Although I had to remember, what it's like to be a student again and battling urges to plant my head straight through the wall at times - I somehow managed to be able to call myself a full-fledged developer!",

P.S. I have made a lot of guided YouTube projects myself.. I just absorb the knowledge - I have no shame!",
