Just like every project highlighted in my Portfolio PlayGround - this one was no exception when it came to acquiring knowledge about fresh, unique and interesting topics! 😎  
Media playback, subscription gateway or using Backend as a service - these were only some of the new, super exciting things that I got to play around with in this project! Trying new solutions for things like database, file storage or authentication is always really interesting, because you become very diverse in your tool-set and also get a chance to solidify old knowledge by spotting similarities from previously used technology, that unavoidably strengthens your understanding of basic concepts. 💡

The majority of backend functionality for this music application was trusted to [SupaBase](https://supabase.com/) and I must say it delivered.. 🚚 It felt similar to when I first tried Tailwind, which to this day has been irreplaceable for me, when it comes to styling. Although I do not plan to use this solution for every possible project - I can't deny the fact that it was an absolute pleasure to work with.

- First of all _Postgres_ is really fast and reliable - so using it under the hood, means good performance and raises the overall quality of the project. 💎

- Secondly I was really impressed with the Authentication and all the tools provided with it! It definitely rivals the best in the game for what I got to see in form of features, developer and user experience. 🧰

- As the third big advantage, I need to highlight the file storage provided - which also felt really great to work with. I had some experience with Amazon S3 buckets in some previous training projects, but solution from [SupaBase](https://supabase.com/) somehow felt more intuitive for me. 🔥

The biggest challenge once again fell on the payment implementation front, where the task was to incorporate subscription based solution that mimics a real model for receiving premium features of an application. What made it challenging for me, was the confusing local environment setup to test the webhook locally and also a gigantic boiler plate code for stripe subscription. I also want to mention that in a future project - the setup of stripe webhook for local testing did not feel hard at all.. But that probably is the case for everything that you do repeatedly after the initial struggle - I guess that's just a normal process of learning and getting better at doing things 📈

User interface primarily consists of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) styled with good old [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

To sum it up - I consider this application to be a really valuable addition to my portfolio as a representation of high quality, clean and maintainable code structure that I am always striving towards! 🙏🏽
