Since the day, when ChatGPT became my full-time teacher and source of instant advice, concerning everything related to coding - one of my goals, was to develop something using this amazing piece of technology. 📚  
Chatting with a computer, that felt like having a conversation with a very knowledgeable human, seemed like something out of sci-fi movies 🌌 to say the least...

In this training project two independent API's were used:

- OpenAPI
- Replicate

I had some experience with Replicate, because when I initially started developing my PlayGround Portfolio, I implemented a model using Replicate, that allowed a user to draw a doodle and have an AI generate a high quality, detailed picture out of it. I wanted it to be one of the interactive tasks for the PlayGround, but my nephew was so excited for this new feature, that my _Free tier_ for the API was gone on the first day of implementation. 😂

I've set up a small monthly budget for both API's so that my guests are able to play a bit, but, please, don't be too sad if the spending limit is reached on the day, when you are visiting the app. 🙏🏽 The wait time for some operations could be pretty long as well - because Replicate API has a _cold start_ that will take some time on the initial attempt. The hobby plan of vercel is also limiting our wait time. ⏲ All of these issues present us with an opportunity to explore hooks and edge functions in the near future to make up for the drawbacks of this initial training project.

One cool feature of this project, is the ability to limit users to free generation counts and ask them to upgrade to _Premium_ tier afterwards. This logic is handled by implementation of Stripe payment and uses a working webhook that can be successfully triggered, using the mock data provided by Stripe (Card Nr. 42(42), everything else can be random). 💰

All in all, this lightweight AI training project laid a very sturdy foundation in my head of how _SaaS_ applications are made and managed. It was really fun to explore different setups for models and default prompts to match the model behavior to the intended use case of a particular section in the app. 🤖 I hope you will have some fun playing with it, because I had a lot of fun developing and learning this awesome technology. I will definitely dedicate more of my free time to create and explore more complex projects using AI tools! 🔫
