My competitive spirit and unmatched work ethic were my trustworthy sidekicks for entirety of this journey. Despite having to remember, what it's like to be a student again and at times battling urges to plant my head straight through the wall - I somehow reached a point where I was able to call myself a developer!üîß",

      "I made this portfolio playground to be enjoyed by people who will potentially share their time with me in the future, my brothers in arms as I like to say.

I do tend to mix a little bit of humor and fantasy into my craft, but don't worry, I am able to switch to my 'formal' mode at will if situation calls for it üßê So enjoy your stay and please continue.. Your reward for participation will be an in-depth information and interesting facts about everything you will see here. There will be an option to skip some tasks if you're in a hurry üîí",
