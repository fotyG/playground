      "I embarked on this dangerous journey of becoming a developer to seek for answers.. This quest was about finding, what else I can become exceptionally good at besides video games.🎮 While clicking heads, dominating little kids on their favorite game or achieving any feat at ease - it all became clear to me.

      "So I left my home..🏡 Alright, I didn't, but starting something so foreign and new to me - really felt like a big step outside of comfort zone. But there is one trait that I really like about myself - I always finish what I have started. My competitive spirit and unmatched work ethic were my trustworthy sidekicks for entirety of this journey. Although I had to remember, what it's like to be a student again and battling urges to plant my head straight through the wall at times - I somehow managed to be able to call myself a full-fledged developer!🔧",

      "I made this portfolio playground to be enjoyed by people who will potentially share their time with me in the future, my brothers in arms as I like to say. I will showcase a unique approach and demonstrate my newly acquired skills and different techniques that I used to build cool things throughout my quest. So enjoy your trip and continue on.. One little note: a playground needs some local cash to operate, so you'll have to do some tasks to earn your share and unlock the secret section🔒",
